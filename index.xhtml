<p>Yale Library’s approaches to collection assessment are Gathering annually and to report the collection metrics to the Association of Research Libraries, and to use COUNTER data for renewal and cancellation decisions (Linden et al., 2017). The process of collection development comprises selection and deselection of materials, planning of strategies and evaluation of collections to be sure in fulfilling the user demands (Gabriel, 1995, as cited in Xie & Matusiak, 2016). Gertz (2011) noted ‘‘several of the most cited digital collection selection criteria, including value and demand, copyrights, technical feasibility, infrastructure, added value, and cost’’ (Gertz, 2011, as cited in Xie & Matusiak, 2016).</p>

<p>Karuk Tribe, Hillman et al. (2017) described planning tasks to build a digital repository that include ‘‘(a) conducting a user needs assessment to determine more specific collection goals and priorities, (b) develop-ment of guiding policies, (c) researching and selecting digital infrastructure based on identified needs, and (d) development of training curriculum for an internship that would be the basis for cataloging materials into the library’’.</p>

<p>To start a digital library several agencies such as government, private sector, international agency etc. can take part as funding sources (Calhoun, 2017). Community collaboration for libraries and library consortia can play a significant role in controlling expense and maximizing efficiency of a digital library. Collaborative projects are important in libraries for enhanced collection coordination and credibility, and because of community obligation (Gwynn, 2016).  Baker & Evans (2013, p. 59) noted, one of the most important factors of collaborative project to be successes is ‘‘cooperation and collaboration on a community-wide scale’’.</p>

<p>It is common to use the software, Google Analytics to study usage of electronic resources. To examine the visitor numbers, what and how many pages are visited by them, how long the visitors stay on each page etc. are possible by using Google Analytics. Data regarding collections are collected using Google Analytics on the parameters such as collection name, collection size (Number of items), starting year etc. to find out results for collection evaluation (Biswas, P. and Marchesoni, J., 2016).</p>
